🧠 SMARTINI3: Systematic Parametrization of Realistic Multi-Scale Membrane Models using unsupervised learning 

SMARTINI3 is a minimal yet realistic ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) membrane model, systematically parameterized using unsupervised learning and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.
It is designed to retain the biophysical fidelity of lipid membranes while enabling large-scale, efficient simulations, especially those involving Martini membrane proteins.

## 💡 Parametrization Framework

SMARTINI3 uses the **genetic algorithms (GAs)** evolutionary computation framework for parameter optimization.

### 🔬 Genetic Algorithms Integration

The parameter optimization leverages **genetic algorithms (GAs)** to iteratively improve model fidelity.
