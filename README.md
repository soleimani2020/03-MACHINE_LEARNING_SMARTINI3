ðŸ§  SMARTINI3: Systematic Parametrization of Realistic Multi-Scale Membrane Models

SMARTINI3 is a minimal yet realistic ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) membrane model, systematically parameterized using unsupervised learning and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.
It is designed to retain the biophysical fidelity of lipid membranes while enabling large-scale, efficient simulations, especially those involving Martini membrane proteins.
